## EEPROM Storage ##

- (a)
static_assert is for testing at compile time
assert is for testing at runtime

*static_assert(sizeof(int) == 4,"int should be 4 bytes");*
*assert(("mypointer  should never be null!", mypointer != nullptr));*

- (b)
testing at compile time is benefitial for preventing bugs even before code is run --> less debugging necessary 

- (c)
must be a constant expression known at compile time

- (d)
*assert(eeprom && "Memory allocation failed");*
asserts if eeprom pointer and the following String are same (both are true, because they are not NULL)
